Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
In a cavern, in a canyon excavating for a mine. Dwelt a miner, forty-niner and his daughter, Clementine.
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
Light she was and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine. Herring boxes, without topses sandals were for Clementine.
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
Drove she ducklings to the water ev'ry morning just at nine. Hit her foot against a splinter, fell into the foaming brine.
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
Ruby lips above the water, blowing bubbles, soft and fine. But, alas, I was no swimmer. So I lost my Clementine.
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
How I missed her! How I missed her, How I missed my Clementine. But I kissed her little sister, I forgot my Clementine.
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine. You are lost and gone forever. Dreadful sorry, Clementine.
